# Moosic Spotify Playlist Automation Project

## Project Overview
This project was run in Aug-Sep 2024 as part of the WBS CODING SCHOOL Data Analytics Bootcamp.

Moosic is a start-up that curates playlists with a personal touch, encapsulating various moods and styles. 
Users can subscribe and listen through their preferred music apps like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music.
As Moosic scales rapidly, the creation of new playlists by music experts has become slow. We have been hired to use Data Science to automate playlist creation.
By the end of this project, we are expected to present our clusters to the team and discuss these questions with them.


## Project Goal
1. **Dataset Utilization**: Use a dataset collected from the Spotify API that contains audio features (tempo, energy, danceabilityâ€¦) for a few thousand songs.
2. **Clustering Algorithm**: Apply a basic clustering algorithm such as K-Means to divide the dataset into clusters, which will become playlists.
3. **Prototype Development**: Develop an initial prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of using Data Science for playlist creation.


## Languages and Libraries Used
- **Languages:**
  - Python

- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
 
## Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Gather audio features using the Spotify API (in this project we used given data containing 5000 songs).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the data.
3. **Clustering**: Implement K-Means and determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. **Evaluation**: Compare clusters to humanly curated playlists and gather expert feedback.
5. **Presentation**: Present the prototype and discuss findings.

## Key Learnings and Challenges Overcome
1. **Unsupervised Machine Learning**:
   - Learned about unsupervised machine learning and its application in automation.

2. **Managing Large Datasets**:
   - Dealing with 5000 playlists and 25 clusters was challenging for gaining an overview of the vibe of music for each cluster.

3. **Understanding Music Beyond Numbers**:
   - Initially found it difficult to feel the music through numerical data alone, but listening to the music in each group was helpful for better understanding.
